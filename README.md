# üõ°Ô∏è HashChecker

**HashChecker** is a security-focused web application built as part of my effort to pursue hands-on learning and deepen my understanding of Cybersecurity concepts.

The app simulates a realistic threat detection pipeline: the backend is deployed with Docker on an AWS EC2 instance, while the frontend is a locally running React interface that allows users to scan files or hashes using the VirusTotal API.
