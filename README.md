# üõ°Ô∏è HashChecker

**HashChecker** is a security-focused web application built as part of my effort to pursue hands-on learning and deepen my understanding of Cybersecurity concepts.

The app simulates a realistic threat detection pipeline: the backend is deployed with Docker on an AWS EC2 instance, while the frontend is a locally running React interface that allows users to scan files or hashes using the VirusTotal API.

## What It Does
- Accepts file uploads or direct hash input (SHA-256)
- Calculates the hash of the uploaded file automatically
- Sends the hash to the VirusTotal API for analysis
- Displays the number of antivirus engines that marked the file as:
  - Harmless
  - Malicious
  - Suspicious
  - Undetected
- Saves the scan result as a `.json` file (locally on the backend)
- Shows results in a clean, web-based user interface
- Can be used both locally and from a cloud deployment
